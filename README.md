**Quote Master â€“ A Text-Based Challenge**

Quote Master is an interactive game where players must create a quote similar to a randomly selected system-generated quote. Similarity is measured using TF-IDF and Cosine Similarity, and a score above 0.5 results in a win.

Players have 15 seconds to submit their quote. If they fail to respond in time, they lose. If the input is not similar enough, they get another quote, but the countdown continues without resetting.

The game integrates natural language processing (NLP) techniques and real-time constraints, making it both a creative and fast-paced challenge.
