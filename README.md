**Part A**
**Student Group Analysis & Competition**

Developed a Python-based system to analyze student group memberships and competition participation using set operations, inverted indexing, and Natural Language Processing (NLP). The project involved:

Identifying common students across multiple groups while applying exclusion rules.
Combining student lists to form a new group.
Implementing an inverted index to determine student participation in competitions.
Using POS tagging (NLTK) to extract proper nouns (NNP) from competition descriptions and identify missing participants.
This project strengthened my skills in file handling, data processing, NLP, and set operations in Python.


**Part B**
**Quote Master â€“ A Text-Based Challenge**

Quote Master is an interactive game where players must create a quote similar to a randomly selected system-generated quote. Similarity is measured using TF-IDF and Cosine Similarity, and a score above 0.5 results in a win.

Players have 15 seconds to submit their quote. If they fail to respond in time, they lose. If the input is not similar enough, they get another quote, but the countdown continues without resetting.

The game integrates natural language processing (NLP) techniques and real-time constraints, making it both a creative and fast-paced challenge.
